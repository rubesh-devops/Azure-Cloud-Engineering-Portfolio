# 🚀 Azure AzCopy – High-Speed Blob-to-Blob Data Transfer

---

## 📌 **Project Overview**

Implemented **high-performance data transfer using Azure AzCopy** to copy data between **Azure Blob Storage containers**.

This assignment demonstrates how **AzCopy**, a command-line utility optimized for speed and efficiency, is used to move large volumes of data across Azure Storage accounts—commonly required in migration and data synchronization scenarios.

---

## 🏗 **Architecture Components**

- **Microsoft Azure**
- **Azure Storage Accounts (Source & Destination)**
- **Azure Blob Containers**
- **AzCopy Utility**
- **Azure Resource Manager (ARM)**

---

## 🎯 **Objective**

To perform efficient data transfer by:

- Reusing existing Azure Storage Accounts
- Copying data between Blob containers
- Using **AzCopy** for fast, reliable transfers
- Understanding command-line based data movement in Azure

---

## ⚙️ **Implementation Steps**

### 1️⃣ **Reuse Existing Storage Accounts**

- Used the **same Azure Storage Accounts** created in the previous assignment
- Identified source and destination Blob containers
- Verified access permissions for data transfer

---

### 2️⃣ **AzCopy Configuration**

- Installed / accessed **AzCopy utility**
- Authenticated AzCopy with Azure Storage
- Verified connectivity to source and destination containers

---

### 3️⃣ **Data Copy Operation**

- Executed **AzCopy commands** to copy data:
  - From source Blob container
  - To destination Blob container
- Monitored transfer progress
- Verified successful data copy

---

## 🔐 **Security & Governance Configuration**

- Used secure authentication methods for AzCopy
- Ensured least-privilege access to storage resources
- Maintained data integrity during transfer
- Followed Azure best practices for secure data movement
