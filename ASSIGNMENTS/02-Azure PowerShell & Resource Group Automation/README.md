# ⚡ Azure PowerShell & Resource Group Automation

---

## 📌 **Project Overview**

Implemented Azure resource management using **Azure PowerShell**, enabling command-line based administration and automation of Azure resources.

This assignment demonstrates how **Azure PowerShell** can be used to securely connect to an Azure account and provision infrastructure resources programmatically, which is essential for scripting, automation, and DevOps workflows.

## 🏗 **Architecture Components**

- **Microsoft Azure Portal**
- **Azure PowerShell**
- **Azure Resource Group**
- **Azure Subscription**
- **Azure Regional Deployment (South Central US)**

---

## 🎯 **Objective**

To perform Azure administration tasks that:

- Connect Azure PowerShell to an Azure account
- Provision resources using PowerShell commands
- Organize resources using **Azure Resource Groups**
- Deploy infrastructure in a specific Azure region
- Enable automation-ready Azure management

---

## ⚙️ **Implementation Steps**

### 1️⃣ **Azure PowerShell Connection**

- Opened **Azure PowerShell**
