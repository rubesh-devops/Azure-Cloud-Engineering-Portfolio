# ⚙️ Azure CLI & PowerShell – Resource Group Automation (Advanced Practice)

---

## 📌 **Project Overview**

Performed advanced Azure resource administration by using both **Azure CLI** and **Azure PowerShell** to manage multiple **resource groups across regions**.

This assignment reinforces automation skills by provisioning multiple Azure resource groups and querying infrastructure state using different Azure management tools, a common requirement in enterprise and DevOps environments.

---

## 🏗 **Architecture Components**

- **Microsoft Azure**
- **Azure CLI**
- **Azure PowerShell**
- **Azure Resource Groups**
- **Azure Regional Deployment (West US)**

---

## 🎯 **Objective**

To strengthen Azure automation capabilities by:

- Creating multiple resource groups programmatically
- Deploying resources in a specific Azure region
- Listing and validating resource groups based on region
- Using both Azure CLI and PowerShell interchangeably
- Preparing for script-based and CI/CD-driven Azure management

---

## ⚙️ **Implementation Steps**

### 1️⃣ **Resource Group Creation Using Automation Tools**

- Authenticated to Azure using **Azure CLI**
- Created **three additional Azure Resource Groups** in:
  - **Region:** West US
- Repeated the same provisioning process using **Azure PowerShell**
- Ensured successful execution through command outputs

---

### 2️⃣ **Listing Resource Groups by Region**

- Queried Azure to list **all resource groups deployed in West US**
- Validated results using both CLI and PowerShell
- Confirmed accurate filtering and visibility of Azure resources

---

## 🔐 **Security & Governance Configuration**

- Used Azure-managed authentication and authorization
- Verified active subscription context before execution
- Applied resource grouping for governance and cost management
- Followed Azure best practices for scripted infrastructure operations

---

## 📈 **Key Learning Outcomes**

- Azure CLI advanced usage
- Azure PowerShell automation
- Bulk resource provisioning
- Regional resource discovery
- Infrastructure inventory management
- DevOps-oriented Azure administration

---

## 🏆 **Real-World Use Case**

This approach is commonly applied in:

- Enterprise Azure environment setup
- Dev/Test/Prod environment provisioning
- DevOps automation pipelines
- Cloud governance and auditing
- Infrastructure inventory reporting

---

## 📊 **Outcome**

Successfully created **multiple Azure resource groups in West US** using **Azure CLI and Azure PowerShell**, and listed all regional resource groups, validating automation and discovery workflows.

---
