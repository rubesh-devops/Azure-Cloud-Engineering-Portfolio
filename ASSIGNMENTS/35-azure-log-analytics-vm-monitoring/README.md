# 📈 Azure Monitoring – Log Analytics Integration with Virtual Machines

---

## 📌 **Project Overview**

Integrated **Azure Log Analytics** with **existing Azure Virtual Machines** to enable centralized **log collection, monitoring, and analysis**.

This assignment demonstrates how Azure Monitoring provides **deep operational visibility** into VM performance, logs, and system data using **Log Analytics workspaces**.

---

## 🏗 **Architecture Components**

- **Microsoft Azure**
- **Azure Virtual Machines**
- **Azure Log Analytics Workspace**
- **Azure Monitor**
- **Azure Monitor Agent**
- **Azure Resource Manager (ARM)**

---

## 🎯 **Objective**

To enable centralized monitoring by:

- Using previously deployed Azure VMs
