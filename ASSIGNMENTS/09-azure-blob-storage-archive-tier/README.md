# 🗄️ Azure Blob Storage – Access Tier Management (Archive Tier)

---

## 📌 **Project Overview**

Implemented **Azure Blob Storage lifecycle and cost optimization** by creating a storage account, uploading files to Blob storage, and changing the **access tier to Archive**.

This assignment demonstrates how Azure enables **cost-efficient storage management** by allowing data to be moved between access tiers based on usage patterns.
