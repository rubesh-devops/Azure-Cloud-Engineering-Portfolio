# 🖼️ Azure Virtual Machine – Custom Image Creation from Linux VM

---

## 📌 **Project Overview**

Created a **custom Azure VM image** by provisioning a **Linux (Ubuntu) virtual machine**, installing **Apache2 web server**, and capturing the VM as a reusable image.

This assignment demonstrates how Azure enables **golden image creation**, allowing organizations to standardize VM deployments with preconfigured software for consistency, scalability, and faster provisioning.

## 🏗 **Architecture Components**

- **Microsoft Azure**
- **Azure Virtual Machine**
- **Ubuntu Linux Image**
- **Apache2 Web Server**
- **Azure Managed Image**
- **Azure Virtual Network**
- **Network Security Group (NSG)**

---

## 🎯 **Objective**

To create a reusable VM image that:

- Uses Ubuntu Linux as the base OS
- Includes pre-installed application software (Apache2)
- Enables faster and consistent VM deployments
- Supports scalable and standardized infrastructure provisioning

---

## ⚙️ **Implementation Steps**

### 1️⃣ **Linux VM Deployment**

- Created an **Azure Virtual Machine**
- Selected:
  - **Operating System:** Ubuntu Linux
- Verified successful VM provisioning
- Connected to the VM using SSH

---

### 2️⃣ **Apache2 Installation**

- Installed **Apache2 web server** on the Linux VM
- Started and verified Apache service
- Confirmed web server functionality
- Prepared the VM with required application configuration

---

### 3️⃣ **Custom Image Creation**

- Deallocated the virtual machine
- Created a **custom Azure VM image** from the configured VM
- Verified image availability in Azure
- Prepared image for reuse in future deployments

---

## 🔐 **Security & Governance Configuration**

- Used NSG rules to control inbound access
- Ensured minimal open ports during configuration
- Followed Azure best practices for image creation
- Prepared secure, reusable infrastructure components

---

## 📈 **Key Learning Outcomes**

- Azure Linux VM provisioning
- Apache2 web server installation
