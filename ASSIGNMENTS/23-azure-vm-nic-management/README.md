# 🔌 Azure Virtual Machine – Network Interface (NIC) Creation & Attachment

---

## 📌 **Project Overview**

Implemented **advanced network interface management** by creating a **Network Interface (NIC)** and attaching it to an **existing Azure Virtual Machine**.

This assignment demonstrates how Azure allows flexible network configurations by decoupling **compute and networking**, enabling scenarios such as multi-NIC VMs, network reconfiguration, and traffic isolation.

---

## 🏗 **Architecture Components**

- **Microsoft Azure**
- **Azure Virtual Machine**
- **Azure Network Interface (NIC)**
- **Azure Virtual Network**
- **Subnet**
- **Network Security Group (NSG)**

---

## 🎯 **Objective**

To enhance VM networking capabilities by:

- Reusing an existing Azure Virtual Machine
- Creating a new Network Interface
- Attaching the NIC to the VM
- Understanding modular network configuration in Azure

---

## ⚙️ **Implementation Steps**

### 1️⃣ **Using Existing Virtual Machine**

- Identified the **previously created Azure VM**
- Verified VM state and network configuration
- Prepared the VM for NIC attachment

---

### 2️⃣ **Network Interface Creation**

- Created a new **Azure Network Interface**
- Associated the NIC with:
  - Appropriate **Virtual Network**
  - Correct **Subnet**
- Applied required NSG rules
- Verified NIC availability

---

### 3️⃣ **NIC Attachment to VM**

- Attached the newly created **NIC** to the existing VM
- Verified successful association
- Confirmed VM network configuration update

---

## 🔐 **Security & Governance Configuration**

- Applied Network Security Groups to NIC
- Ensured controlled inbound and outbound traffic
- Followed Azure best practices for network isolation
- Maintained secure VM networking setup

---

## 📈 **Key Learning Outcomes**
