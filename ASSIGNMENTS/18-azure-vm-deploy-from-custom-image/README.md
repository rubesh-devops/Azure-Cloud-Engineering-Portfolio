# 🚀 Azure Virtual Machine – Deployment from Custom Image & Web Server Validation

---

## 📌 **Project Overview**

Deployed an **Azure Virtual Machine from a custom Linux image** and validated application availability by configuring network access and starting the **Apache2 web server**.

This assignment demonstrates how **custom VM images** can be reused to rapidly provision application-ready servers, ensuring consistency, scalability, and reduced deployment time.

---

## 🏗 **Architecture Components**

- **Microsoft Azure**
- **Azure Virtual Machine**
- **Custom Azure VM Image**
- **Ubuntu Linux**
- **Apache2 Web Server**
- **Azure Virtual Network**
- **Network Security Group (NSG)**

---

## 🎯 **Objective**

To validate reusable infrastructure by:

- Deploying a VM from a previously created custom image
- Allowing HTTP access through NSG
- Starting and verifying Apache2 service
- Confirming web application accessibility via browser

---

## ⚙️ **Implementation Steps**

### 1️⃣ **VM Deployment from Custom Image**

- Selected the **custom Azure VM image** created earlier
- Deployed a new **Azure Virtual Machine**
- Verified successful VM provisioning
- Connected to the VM using SSH

---

### 2️⃣ **Network Security Configuration**

- Updated **Network Security Group (NSG)** rules
- Opened **Port 80 (HTTP)** for inbound traffic
- Ensured secure and controlled web access

---

### 3️⃣ **Apache2 Service Validation**

- Started the **Apache2 service** on the VM
- Verified service status and availability
- Ensured web server was running correctly

---

### 4️⃣ **Website Access Verification**

- Accessed the VM using its **public IP address**
- Verified Apache default web page loaded successfully
- Confirmed end-to-end web server accessibility

---

## 🔐 **Security & Governance Configuration**

- Restricted inbound traffic to required ports only
- Used NSG rules for network-level access control
- Followed Azure best practices for web server exposure
- Ensured secure VM access and service validation

---

## 📈 **Key Learning Outcomes**

- VM deployment using custom images
- NSG configuration for HTTP access
- Apache2 service management
- Web server validation on Azure
- Reusable infrastructure concepts
- Production-ready VM provisioning

---

## 🏆 **Real-World Use Case**

This approach is widely used for:

- Rapid web server provisioning
- Auto Scaling and VM Scale Set deployments
- Standardized application environments
- Dev/Test/Prod consistency
- Cloud-based web hosting solutions

---

## 📊 **Outcome**

Successfully deployed a **Linux VM from a custom image**, configured network access, and verified **Apache2 web server availability**, confirming a fully functional and reusable cloud deployment.

---
