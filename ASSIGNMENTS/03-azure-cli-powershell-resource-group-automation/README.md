# ⚙️ Azure CLI & PowerShell – Resource Group Automation

---

## 📌 **Project Overview**

Implemented **resource group automation and discovery** in Microsoft Azure using both **Azure CLI** and **Azure PowerShell**.

This assignment demonstrates how multiple Azure administration tools can be used together to **provision resources programmatically** and **query infrastructure state**, which is a core requirement for DevOps and cloud operations teams.

---

## 🏗 **Architecture Components**

- **Microsoft Azure**
- **Azure CLI**
- **Azure PowerShell**
- **Azure Resource Groups**
- **Azure Regional Deployment (West US)**

---

## 🎯 **Objective**

To automate Azure resource management by:

- Creating multiple resource groups using CLI and PowerShell
- Deploying resources in a specific Azure region
- Listing and validating resource groups based on region
- Gaining proficiency with Azure administrative tooling

---

## ⚙️ **Implementation Steps**

### 1️⃣ **Resource Group Creation Using Azure CLI & PowerShell**

- Connected to Azure using **Azure CLI**
- Created multiple **Azure Resource Groups** in:
  - **Region:** West US
- Repeated the same operation using **Azure PowerShell**
- Ensured consistency across both tools

---

### 2️⃣ **Listing Resource Groups by Region**

- Queried Azure to list all **resource groups deployed in West US**
- Verified results using CLI and PowerShell commands
- Confirmed accurate filtering based on Azure region

---

## 🔐 **Security & Governance Configuration**

- Used Azure-managed authentication mechanisms
- Ensured correct subscription context before execution
- Applied resource grouping for improved governance
- Followed best practices for scripted Azure administration

---

## 📈 **Key Learning Outcomes**

- Azure CLI automation
- Azure PowerShell scripting
- Multi-resource provisioning
- Regional resource management
- Infrastructure discovery and validation
- Azure governance fundamentals
