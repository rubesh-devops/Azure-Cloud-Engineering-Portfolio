# 🐳 Azure VM – Docker Installation & Container Image Management

---

## 📌 **Project Overview**

Implemented **containerization on Azure** by installing **Docker on a Linux virtual machine**, pulling a public Docker image from **Docker Hub**, and modifying the container repository.

This assignment demonstrates how Azure VMs can be used as **container hosts** for running and managing Docker-based applications, forming the foundation for modern DevOps and cloud-native workflows.

---

## 🏗 **Architecture Components**

- **Microsoft Azure**
- **Azure Virtual Machine (Linux)**
- **Docker Engine**
- **Docker Hub**
- **Container Image: hshar/webapp**
- **Linux File System**

---

## 🎯 **Objective**

To enable container-based application workflows by:

- Installing Docker on an Azure VM
- Pulling a Docker image from Docker Hub
- Working with container files and repositories
- Gaining hands-on experience with Docker on cloud infrastructure

---

## ⚙️ **Implementation Steps**

### 1️⃣ **Docker Installation on Azure VM**

- Provisioned a **Linux-based Azure Virtual Machine**
- Installed **Docker Engine**
- Verified Docker installation and service status
- Ensured VM was ready for container operations

---

### 2️⃣ **Pulling Docker Image from Docker Hub**

- Pulled the public Docker image:
  - **Repository:** `hshar/webapp`
- Verified successful image download
- Listed available Docker images on the VM

---

### 3️⃣ **Repository File Modification**

- Accessed the Docker container / repository
- Created a **new file** inside the repository
- Verified file creation and persistence
- Confirmed successful interaction with container resources

---

## 🔐 **Security & Governance Configuration**

- Used secure SSH access to manage the VM
- Followed best practices for Docker installation
- Ensured controlled access to container host
- Maintained isolation between host and container workloads

---

## 📈 **Key Learning Outcomes**

- Docker installation on Azure VM
- Container image management
- Working with Docker Hub repositories
- Basic container operations
- Cloud-based container hosting
- Foundations of containerized application deployment

---

## 🏆 **Real-World Use Case**

This setup is commonly used for:

- Running containerized applications on cloud VMs
- Dev/Test Docker environments
- CI/CD pipeline build agents
- Microservices development
- Transitioning from VM-based apps to containers

---

## 📊 **Outcome**

Successfully installed **Docker on an Azure VM**, pulled the **hshar/webapp** Docker image from Docker Hub, and modified the container repository, validating end-to-end container operations on Azure infrastructure.
