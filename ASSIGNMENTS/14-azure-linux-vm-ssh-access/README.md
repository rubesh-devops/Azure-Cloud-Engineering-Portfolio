## 🏗 **Architecture Components**

- **Microsoft Azure**
- **Azure Virtual Machine**
- **Ubuntu Linux Image**
- **Azure Virtual Network**
- **Network Security Group (NSG)**
- **SSH (Secure Shell)**

---

## 🎯 **Objective**

To deploy and manage a Linux virtual machine by:

- Creating an Azure VM in a specified region
- Selecting an Ubuntu OS image
- Configuring network security to allow SSH access
- Connecting securely to the VM using a terminal

---

## ⚙️ **Implementation Steps**

### 1️⃣ **Azure VM Creation**

- Created an **Azure Virtual Machine**
- Selected:
  - **Region:** West US
  - **Operating System:** Ubuntu Linux
- Verified successful VM provisioning

---

### 2️⃣ **Network & SSH Configuration**

- Configured **Network Security Group (NSG)**
- Opened **Port 22 (SSH)** for inbound access
- Restricted access to allow secure remote connectivity

---

### 3️⃣ **SSH Connection to Linux VM**

- Used terminal-based SSH client
- Connected securely to the Ubuntu VM
- Verified successful login and system access
- Confirmed VM readiness for administration tasks

---

## 🔐 **Security & Governance Configuration**

- Enabled SSH-based authentication
- Controlled inbound traffic using NSG rules
