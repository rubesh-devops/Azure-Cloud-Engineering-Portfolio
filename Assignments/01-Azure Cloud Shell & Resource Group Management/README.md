# ☁️ Azure Cloud Shell & Resource Group Management

---

## 📌 **Project Overview**

Implemented foundational Azure administration tasks by using **Azure Cloud Shell** to manage resources through the command-line interface.

This assignment demonstrates how Azure administrators can quickly provision and manage resources using **cloud-native CLI tools** without installing local software, forming the base for all Azure infrastructure operations.

---

## 🏗 **Architecture Components**

- **Microsoft Azure Portal**
- **Azure Cloud Shell**
- **Azure CLI**
- **Azure Resource Group**
- **Azure Regional Deployment (South Central US)**

---

## 🎯 **Objective**

To perform essential Azure setup tasks that:

- Enable command-line access using **Azure Cloud Shell**
- Organize Azure resources using **Resource Groups**
- Deploy resources in a specified Azure region
- Establish a foundation for Azure infrastructure management

---

## ⚙️ **Implementation Steps**

### 1️⃣ **Azure Cloud Shell Access**

- Accessed **Azure Cloud Shell** directly from the Azure Portal
- Selected appropriate shell environment (Bash)
- Verified successful Cloud Shell initialization
